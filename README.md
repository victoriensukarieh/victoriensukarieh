# Hello There! 
After few years of swimming aimlessly in the sea of programming and software development, i decided on my own personal path to widen my knowledge base and harden my technical skills.
Web development seemed like the fastest result-generating learning journey, with simpler tools and softwares.
I am trying to learn web development from scratch, to build a strong understanding of all the components.
To do so i spent some time studying HTML and trying to expose myself to as much terminologies and concepts as possible. Now it is the turn of CSS.
## 🧠what i have in mind to work on:
- [x] HTML
- [ ] CSS
- [ ] Javascript
- [ ] HTTP methods
- [ ] C#
- [ ] .net framework
- [ ] SQL server
- [ ] APIs (REST probably)
- [ ] GIT (including github)
