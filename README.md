# Hello There! 
After few years of swimming aimlessly in the sea of programming and software development, i decided on my own personal path to widen my knowledge base and harden my technical skills.
Web development seemed like the fastest result-generating learning journey, with simpler tools and softwares.
I am trying to learn web development from scratch, to build a strong understanding of all the components.
To do so i spent some time studying HTML and trying to expose myself to as much terminologies and concepts as possible. Now it is the turn of CSS.
## 🧠what i have in mind to work on:
- Front-end Dev
  - [x] HTML
  - [ ] CSS
  - [ ] Javascript
- Programming Langusges
  - [ ] C#
  - [ ] PHP
- Framewroks
  - [ ] .Net 6 (core)
  - [ ] Laravel
  - [ ] Wordpress
  - [ ] JQuery
  - [ ] React
- Databases
  - [ ] MSSQL
  - [ ] MySQL
  - [ ] MongoDB(No-SQL)
- Mobile Dev
  - [ ] React Native
  - [ ] Flutter
- Concepts
  - [ ] HTTP methods
  - [ ] APIs (REST probably)
  - [ ] MVC
  - [ ] Clean Architecture
  - [ ] Agile Development
- Version Control
  - [ ] GIT (including github)
